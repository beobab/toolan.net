Single table from lots of databases
===============

Have you ever wanted to select something from all of the databases on a single server, 
but you need them all into a single table? Wow, are you ever in luck! That's exactly what
I wanted to show you today! Spooky.

For those of you who are only here for the code, I present this lovely snippet for you to 
copy and go on your merry way, bereft of understanding, happy in the knowledge that you 
have found what you need.

    DECLARE @sql nvarchar(max); 
    SELECT @sql = substring((
    	SELECT ' UNION ALL SELECT ''' + name + ''' AS dbname, OptionValue FROM ' + name + '.dbo.Option WHERE OptionId = 12'
    	FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases 
    	WHERE name LIKE ('Customer[_]%')
    	AND HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME(name + '.dbo.Option', 'OBJECT', 'SELECT') = 1 
    	FOR XML PATH(''), type).value('/', 'nvarchar(max)')
    , 12, 99999); 
    EXEC (@sql);

Which gives you:

    +-------------+-------------|
    | dbname      | OptionValue |
    --------------+-------------|
    | Customer_01 | 129         |
    | Customer_02 | 128         |
    | Customer_03 | 129         |
    | Customer_04 | 128         |
    | Customer_05 | 128         |
    | Customer_06 | 128         |
    | Customer_07 | 128         |
    | Customer_08 | 129         |
    | Customer_09 | 128         |
    | Customer_10 | 128         |
    | Customer_11 | 128         |
    | Customer_12 | 128         |
    | Customer_13 | 127         |
    +-------------+-------------+


For those who say "Why not just use sp_MSForEachDb?" I say "By all means. Go forth and do so."

All the clever, good looking, wise and appreciative folk still with us? Good.

This query takes all databases on the current server, checks to see if they have an Option table 
that you can select from, finds OptionId 12 in each one, and returns a single table with the results. 
sp_MSForEachDb gives you a different table for each database, which may be what you want. It isn't 
what I wanted when I wrote this.

We'll split it up here:

The outside first, because well, find something that's easy to explain and go from there?

    DECLARE @sql nvarchar(max); 
    SELECT @sql = (some string)
	EXEC (@sql);

This puts some stuff into a (very long) string variable, and runs it. If this doesn't work, then this 
whole method probably isn't for you.

In to the middle for a bit (I like jumping around).

	SELECT (some string)
    FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases 
    WHERE name LIKE ('Customer[_]%')
    AND HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME(name + '.dbo.Option', 'OBJECT', 'SELECT') = 1 

This finds all the databases which have an object called Option that you (the user running this query) 
have permission to select from. Note: name + 'dbo.Option' is significant. That makes sure that each 
database gets checked, and not just the database you're running in currently (which could easily be master).

    SELECT (
	    SELECT (some text)
	    (some query)
	    FOR XML PATH(''), type
	).value('/', 'nvarchar(max)')

This returns '(some text)(some text)...(some text)'

This is the bit that typically makes people say "I'm sorry, what? How?".

It's a convert into XML and then extract the root into a string which has the "side effect" of concatenating
all the items returned together into one long string.

I'll go a bit slower.

    SELECT name FROM sysdatabases
	FOR XML PATH(''), type
	
That returns an XML object that looks like this: 

    <name>master</name>
	<name>msdb</name>
	<name>tempdb</name>
	<name>Customer_01</name>
	...
	<name>Customer_13</name>

Then we ask sql to give us the value of the root (/) as an 'nvarchar(max)'

	DECLARE @xml XML = '<name>master</name>
						<name>msdb</name>
						<name>tempdb</name>
						<name>Customer_01</name>
						...
						<name>Customer_13</name>';

	SELECT @xml.value('/', 'nvarchar(max)');
	
As you can see (you are trying this as we go alone, aren't you?), spaces are not inserted between each item, 
but you should see that escape characters which XML would normally escape are correctly sent back to you. 
This is a good thing, and will stand you in good stead when ジョナサントゥーラン wants his own database. 
As you know, he is a fine developer, and often puts restricted characters in his database names to help you learn.

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091945/what-characters-do-i-need-to-escape-in-xml-documents]

So we've got it saying "Customer_01Customer_02..Customer_13" now. Let's make it a little more useful.

    SELECT (
	    SELECT 'SELECT * FROM ' + name + '.dbo.Option'
	    FROM sysdatabases
	    FOR XML PATH(''), type
	).value('/', 'nvarchar(max)')

Now it says "SELECT * FROM Customer_01.dbo.OptionSELECT * FROM Customer_02.dbo.OptionSELECT..."
